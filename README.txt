To run this project, download project files and double click the 'contactList.html' file which will open the project on your preferred browser.

I have used both Bootstrap and Vue.js CDNs within this project.

The 'git-branch-logs' folder contains all logs of each branch that has been made during this project. The 'feature' branches were used to work on individual features of this project. The 'develop' branch was used to merge any completed 
features, and was used to make sure everything was running before sending it to the 'main' branch, which was the 'ready for production' branch.

The 'git-files' folder contains the copied '.git' files for a more in-depth look.

Git Bash was used for this project and then uploaded to GitHub.
